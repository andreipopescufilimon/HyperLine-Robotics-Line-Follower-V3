# HyperLine Robotics (HLR) V3 - Line Follower Robot

## 🚀 About the Project
The **JSumo HyperLine Robotics (HLR) V3** is an advanced, high-speed **line follower robot** built for competitions. This version is the result of 3 years of prototyping, optimizing both speed and precision without relying on external downforce like an EDF or impeller. As a member of the **JSumo Team**, I have combined **lightweight engineering, high-speed motors, and custom-built sensors and chassis** to achieve high performance.

### **Key Advantages Over Previous Versions**
- **No additional downforce** – Traditional high-speed line followers use EDFs to generate downforce, but HyperLine Robotics V3 achieves comparable speeds **without any additional generated weight**, based on comparisons with a **300g EDF-powered robot (V2)**.
- **Ultra-lightweight design** – The robot is engineered to be significantly light, ensuring agile movements and optimized acceleration.
- **Custom 16-sensor array** – Precision-designed for maximum accuracy, this sensor array system ensures fast detection of the track at all speeds, by using it with our public library.
- **Optimized PCB chassis** – The **chassis PCB** integrates all components efficiently, reducing weight and improving weight balance.
- **Lightweight carbon fiber bars & FPC cables** – The **2mm carbon fiber bars** and **FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) cable** are used to connect the sensors to main PCB chassis, reducing weight while maintaining structural integrity.
- **Custom-built motor mounts & wheels** – The **motor mounts** and **wheel rims** are custom-manufactured from **3D printed using CF PLA (Carbon Fiber PLA)** for improved durability.

## 🔬 **Technical Details & Features**

### **📌 Lightweight**
HyperLine Robotics V3 is engineered to maintain **top speeds comparable to a 300g robot with EDF downforce**, yet it remains **significantly lighter at around 100g**. The key innovation lies in:
- **Optimized weight distribution** – Eliminating unnecessary materials while maintaining structural integrity.
- **High-efficiency silicone wheels** – Ensuring superior grip without extra weight.
- **Advanced motor tuning** – Maximizing power output without requiring additional stabilization, while minimizing vibrations.

### **🎯 Custom-Built 16-Sensor Array**
One of the standout features of HLR V3 is its **custom-designed sensor array**, which drastically improves track detection accuracy:
- **16 individual sensors** for high-resolution tracking.
- **Custom Multiplexer Integration** – Reducing processing overhead and increasing reaction speed.
- **Adaptive Calibration** – Ensuring maximum reliability across different competition conditions.
- **Custom sensor development** – Full details and design can be found in the **my official repository**: [Line Follower 16-Sensors Bar with Multiplexor](https://github.com/andreipopescufilimon/Line-Follower-16-Sensors-Bar-with-Multiplexor)

## 🏆 **Performance & Upcoming Competitions**
With these innovations, HyperLine Robotics V3 has achieved performance levels **comparable to heavier EDF-powered robots**. The **perfect balance of speed, weight, and precision** allows it to compete.

HyperLine Robotics V3 will be competing in the **Robotics Championship 13th Edition**, taking place from **May 15 - 17, 2025**. This event serves as the test for its capabilities before the **InfoMatrix Final** the following week. Additionally, I will introduce an innovative **lightweight impeller-powered robot, HLR V4**, expected to reach **4605+mm/sec on average per lap**.
